Q1. Write a program to input an array and reverse all
its elements.
Input: 5 elements: 1 2 3 4 5
Output: 5 4 3 2 1



Q2. Write a program to input two arrays of the same
size and find their sum into a third array.
Input:
Size of Arrays: 5
First Array: 1 2 3 4 5
Second Array: 5 4 3 2 1
Output:
Sum Array: 6 6 6 6 6



Q3. Write a program to input an array and find the sum
of even and odd numbers separately.
Input: 6 elements: 1 2 3 4 5 6
Output: Sum of Even numbers = 12
 Sum of Odd numbers = 9



Q4. Write a program to input an array and count how
many positive, negative, and zero elements are there.
Input: 7 elements: -3 0 2 -1 5 0 4
Output: Positive: 3
 Negative: 2
 Zero: 2


Q5. Input 8 integers into an array. Print the elements
one by one until the running sum becomes greater than
50.
Example:
Input: {10, 20, 5, 8, 12, 30}
Output: 10 20 5 8 12 Sum is 55


Q6. Write a program to print every element in the array
except every 3rd element using for loop and continue.
Example:
Input: {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
Output: 10 20 40 50 70


Q7. Sort only the positive numbers in the array
(negative numbers stay at their positions).
Use for loops and if only. No sorting library allowed.
Example:
Input: {3, -2, 5, -1, 4}
Output: {3, -2, 4, -1, 5}

# Summer Internship C Programs

This repository contains a collection of C programs and executable files created during the summer internship. The programs cover a variety of fundamental topics in C programming, including arrays, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, loops, functions, and more. The folder structure is organized by topic for easy navigation.

## Folder Structure

- **Basic/**: Simple C programs covering basic concepts (e.g., addition, area calculation, even/odd check).
- **Array/**: Programs related to array operations such as searching, sorting, merging, and summing elements.
- **Function/**: Programs demonstrating the use of functions in C.
- **Loops/**: Programs using different types of loops (for, while, do-while).
- **LeetCode/**: Solutions to selected LeetCode problems in C.
- **Linked List/**: Programs implementing linked list operations.
- **Queue/**, **Stack/**, **Tree/**: Data structure implementations.
- **Recurssion/**: Programs demonstrating recursion.
- **Pointer/**: Programs using pointers.
- **Structure/**: Programs using structures in C.
- **Output Answer/**, **QB/**, **test/**: Miscellaneous and test programs.
- **17-06-25/**: Dated folder with additional C programs.

## Example Programs

- **Sorting Algorithms**: `BubbleSort.c`, `InsertionSort.c`, `selectionSort.c`, `sorting.c`
- **Searching Algorithms**: `LinearSearch.c`, `BinarySearch.c`
- **Array Operations**: `DeleteArrayElm.c`, `SumTwoLarge.c`, `SecondLargestElement.c`, `ReverseAll.c`
- **Miscellaneous**: `Switch.c`, `WhileLoop.c`, `T.c`

## How to Compile and Run

1. Open the folder in VS Code or your preferred IDE.
2. Use the provided build tasks or run the following command in PowerShell (replace `filename.c` with your file):
   
   ```powershell
   gcc filename.c -o filename.exe
   ./filename.exe
   ```

3. For files inside subfolders, navigate to the respective folder before compiling.

## Notes

- Some folders contain both `.c` source files and their compiled `.exe` executables.
- The code is intended for educational purposes and practice.
